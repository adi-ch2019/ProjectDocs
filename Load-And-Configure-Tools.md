Load and Configure Tools

When installing and configuring server software, the developer will need to have system administration privileges, or depending on internal policies, may need to enlist the assistance of someone that does have these rights.

Other common questions you should consider can be summarised by the following:

    Do the server tools of choice have additional hardware and / or software requirements. For example, is the software written in an interpreted or scripted CGI language (eg Perl or Python)?
    Is there a native version of the runtime binary executable program (needed to run the script) for your particular hardware platform? If so what version of the language does it require?
    Will this version of the language impact on other software already successfully running on the server?
    Does the tool have its own installation program or is a manual install required?
    Is a specific install directory structure required?
