Identify Organisational Structure

An organisational structure is usually a diagram showing the reporting and responsibility relationships between staff of an organisation.
As mentioned, most are shown in a graphical form

If you are in a large organisation, you can often find this document on the company's intranet or by asking the Human Resources Department.

If you are in a small organisation, the organisational structure will often be quite simple. It will often consist of an owner-manager-workers or something similar. In this type of business, there is often no documented organisational structure.

Verify Availability

The person or people you decide you want on your support team may or may not be available.

Normally when you offer somebody a position of employment, they must tell you if they accept the offer or if they decline the offer.

The person you want may be available but there may be complications, eg.:

    They may not be available full time
    They may not be available to work at the times your customer needs support
    They may not be available to start immediately

In these cases you may decide to offer the position to somebody else or negotiate with the person you have chosen.
