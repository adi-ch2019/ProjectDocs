Evaluate Tools

Internet searches within the functional requirement areas will yield results (for each tool) that will need to be evaluated with reference to tasks, available resources and budget. Keep in mind the environment you are likely to be working in (Windows, Linux or some flavour of Unix). You should also consider the existing in-house skills (language knowledge and other relevant expertise) that may be required.

Then consider the obvious:

    Does the package work?
    How efficient would you consider the tool to be?
    Does the tool have documentation? How correct, complete and most of all, understandable is it?
    Is the package still being maintained? Is there an issue reporting mechanism in place? Is there a feature enhancement system?
    Is the package still being supported? What are the likely turnaround times for reported issues? Does the vendor care?
    Are there any licensing issues associated with the product?
