Levels of Support

The variety of support levels can be easily visualised using the 'Customer Service Iceberg'.

As you can see from the diagram, the visible part of customer service (the 'front line' delivery) is only the tip of the iceberg. It is supported by many things such as standards, systems, quality issues, management support, etc. This is an important concept to grasp when approaching the setup of a client support agreement. You should understand that by supporting I.T. systems that run in the background, you are, in fact, helping make the business more efficient and competitive. Efficient support of those parts of the iceberg that nobody sees results in better front line service to customers.

There are a number of ways to view 'levels of support'

When discussing 'level of support', you may mean the type of support that is to be provided.

For example, we could offer the following 'levels' (or types) of support:

    Informal Peer Support - workers help their co-workers with problems. The organisation can provide training to key workers so that they are able to be called upon for informal support.
    User support combined with other responsibilities - a dual role of I.T. support and other responsibilities.
    User support as a separate position or group - setting up a dedicated position such as 'I.T. Systems Support Officer' or a unit such as 'Technology Services Group'.
    Help Desk Support - an internal or external support function that provides a broad range of support for business I.T. systems.
    Totally outsourced user support - an external provider provides all necessary support.

Example: Helpdesk support levels

If your support is to include a 'help desk' that is staffed, the following structure is common:

level 1 help desk - takes the calls, logs details, may solve simple problems or give general advice for common problems (eg. advising on network availability).

level 2 help desk - technicians fix the problem or provide advice on how to fix the problem.

level 3 help desk - highly qualified people provide customisation or bug fixes or software or web-based systems.

By 'level of support' you could also mean a tiered system of problem management, based on the urgency of a problem. For example:

    Gold - Problem resolved within 1 hour, onsite
    Silver - Problem resolved within 1 working day
    Bronze - Problem resolved within 3 working days

Finally, when discussing 'levels of support', we may also mean the exact support functions that are going to be put in place.

The following is a list of possible support functionsâ€¦

    Help desk
    Technical troubleshooting
    Training in the use of software
    Preparation and maintenance of documentation
    Installation and configuration of hardware and/or software
    Maintenance of hardware, data, etc. (eg. backups, recovery)
    Customisation of software
    Preparation of new web content (eg. text, graphics)
