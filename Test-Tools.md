Test Tools

Once the tools have been installed and configured it is important to test the tools before they are brought into "live" operation. It is essential to ensure they operate as expected. Testing should involve subjecting the tools to both normal and abnormal conditions. You need to know how the tools will function under both circumstances.

The person or team conducting the tests should develop some test data for all known circumstances. A test plan should be developed that specifies what is to be tested, how it is to be tested and how the test data is to be analysed. After testing a report should be written to show the conclusions drawn from the testing.
