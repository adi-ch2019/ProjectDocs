Establish Procedures

When the tools have been selected and the client has confirmed the suitability of these tools for use in the organisation, procedures for the use of these tools should be considered. The procedures will of course depend on the type of tools under consideration, however the following should be adressed:

    The circumstances under which the tool/s should be deployed. For example, will the tool/s be used in a routine manner (eg predictable circumstances such as daily backups) or in extraordinary circumstances (such as a breach of security)?
    How often will the server tool/s be utilised (eg. daily, weekly, ongoing)?
    Who is permitted to install, monitor and maintain the tool/s?
    How will the effectiveness of the tool/s be monitored and evaluated?

Training for proper use of the tools also needs to be considered. Instructions should be provided by the vendor, but this is not always the case, especially if the tool is open source or freeware. Even when operating instructions are provided by the vendor, they are not always comprehensive. It may be necessary for further training to be considered.

Once procedures have been put in place to establish the correct use of the tools, it is possible to make them available for operational use within the organisation.
